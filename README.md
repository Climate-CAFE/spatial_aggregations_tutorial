# spatial_aggregations_tutorial
Walk through on all-things spatial aggregations. The main focus is aggregating climate/exposure variables over (raster) grids into (GIS vector) polygons. 

This tutorial focuses on these differences:
* What is the difference between gis vector data and rasters?
* What is the difference between overlay vs rasterize?
* What are multiple rasterization strategies?
* What is the difference between downscaling and upsampling?
* What are computationally efficient options for spatial aggregations?
* Example scripts and end-to-end pipelines for spatial aggregations
